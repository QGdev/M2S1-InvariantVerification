## Goal

In concurrent systems, invariants are properties that are always true.
In this homework, we will need to verify invariants on a concurrent system.
It is where we will develop and implement the Transition System, States and logical propositions.
But we will also need to implement and adapt a given pseudo-code algorithm that verify invariants of a transition system.
We did have the choice between two languages to implement the algorithm: Python or C++ but for practical reasons we choose Python in version 3.11.

## Results

The program is able to verify invariants on a transition system.
